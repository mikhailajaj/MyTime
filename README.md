# *Syed: Covid Inform Tracker: 
  https://cloud.degoo.com/share/60L0CIcdWqeQ8d
  The purpose of this application is to inform users about their health status and the severity if symptoms obtained from COVID-19. It would allow the users to check their province’s latest COVID statistics based on the number of cases and recoveries with a visual or a graph as well as enter the symptoms of this virus. It should have location tracking to inform the user of their health status and should be up to date with the number of deaths taken by the virus. In terms of educational information, the app would provide weekly reminders to emphasize the seriousness of this application with guidelines and precautions to prevent further unnecessary risks to the users. The main goal of this app is to get professional advice from health officials once the user enters their health information and symptoms regrading the exposure of COVID-19. This will be achieved through forms that the user has to fill where they will get a simple notification after. In addition, the users will also get voluntarily assistance if the one of their family members or friends decide to help the user due to long-distance calls (if the user lives in B.C and their family member/friend assistant lives in Quebec). This will be achieved through chat box. 
They are three groups of target audience that may use this app. First and foremost are the elders who are at most risk. For them the developers should make sure that the app is readable and easy-to-use. Font style should be simple and big. Different screens should be easily navigable with large sized buttons. Should be as simple as reading a tutorial. Then are the adults who second likely to use this kind of app. For Adults, the developers need to put lots of information regarding COVID-19 cases and the location to finding extra resources. The information and the statistics should be accurate with correct guidelines and precautions. The third are the teenagers. For this group, the developers should make the app exciting and colorful with lots of images and animation. It should visually compelling to this type of audience and the waiting process between each webpage should be no greater than five seconds.
